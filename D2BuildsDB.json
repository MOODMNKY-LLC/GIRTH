Once the meter is depleted, the wielder will fall back to the ground.\n\nThe Manticore's catalyst allows the wielder to build void overshield on combatant final blows and weapon hits on powerful enemies, as well as reduce the accuracy of combatants targeting you."

The grenade final blow activates Volatile Rounds which allows void weapons to do more damage. These rounds will also periodically heal you and your teammates as you deal further damage to them thanks to the Void Titan Aspect Controlled Demolition.\n\nThe grenade final blow also generates an Orb of Power, which will grant Devour once collected. Devour grants grenade energy on final blow, heals you to full health instantly, and refreshes the Devour timer. \n\nThis gameplay loop alone allows you to summon several grenades and have Volatile Rounds proc'd at all times. But this build can take things to new \"heights\".\n\nWhile utilizing the above gameplay loop, mixing in the gliding capabilities from Manticore allows you to rain void munitions down unto your opponents. Final blows and hits on powerful combatants generates a Void Overshield; which grants even more grenade regeneration and buffs your melee ability thanks to Offensive Bulwark! You are also harder to hit while gliding, which can save you from those surprise powerful combatants!\n\nThe idea is gliding with Manticore while having Devour, Volatile Rounds, and a Void Overshield for maximum void explosions and weapon damage!",
    "GameplayLoop": "1) Get grenade final blow to generate an Orb of Power for Devour and proc Volatile Rounds\n2) Build up Antigrav Repulsors from hits on powerful combatants and final blows.\n3) Shoot combatants while airborne to begin gliding; doing more damage, generating Void Overshield, and extending Antigrav Repulsors."

You just need to block when big damage from a boss comes in. \n\nPair this with a Solar subclass because it can make Restoration's timer jump up to 6 seconds with Ember of Solace, and then it can chain all the way up to 12 seconds.

With the gold contender\u2019s boon, you will also have infinite abilities.\n\nArc siphon will allow your Trinity Ghoul to make orbs which you can then pick up to proc your x3 arc weapon surge. Since you can spam your abilities dynamo helps by providing extra super energy when using your class ability. Ashes to assets is also nice by giving you more super energy on grenade kills.

On a finisher Felwinter's Helm will make nearby enemies weakened 30%, Echo of Cessation will release an explosion that makes nearby enemies Volatile and create a Void Breach, and makes you invisible with Echo of Obscurity. The other benefit of a finisher is that it will give an emergency reload to New Pacific Epitaph from its Origin Trait Restoring Ritual. This allows you to quickly shoot this Wave-Frame Grenade Launcher weapon twice in a row.\n\nThe Fragment Echo of Harvest creates an Orb of Power and Void Breach when defeating a weakened enemy which will happen when cleaning up nearby enemies after performing a finisher. The final Fragment is Echo of Undermining which will weaken targets 15% from a Vortex Grenade. Grenades and Child of the Old Gods are good means of weakening an enemy from afar, and the 15% weaken will NOT override the 30% weaken from Felwinter's Helm.\n\nAll of the Orbs of Power and Void Breaches created are leveraged through mods and the Artifact. The Artifact will give a shield when picking up a Void Breach from Protective Breach. Multiple Void Breaches will also give armor charge stacks with the Elemental Charge mod. Orbs of Power will give New Pacific Epitaph a damage boost with Stasis Weapon Surge.",

To acquire an Overshield cast Barricade, stand in Ward of Dawn, hit an enemy with Shield Throw, or get multiple shotgun kills with melee energy available. From there any shotgun kill will refresh the Overshield.\n\nThe main weapon of the build is Legend of Acrius which hits like a truck with damage bonuses from Surge mods and No Backup Plans. Slug Shotguns are an optional addition to the build as well if you are comfortable with hot swapping them. The mods serve to increase the handling and reload speed of Legend of Acrius to improve its usability.\n\nThe rest of the fragments serve to boost the neutral game, improves ease of use, and allows you to weaken targets for a 15% damage boost. Scatter Grenades weaken targets with Echo of Undermining which is used for high health targets before using a shotgun. Echo of Starvation grants Devour on Orb of Power pickup. Lastly Echo of Persistence increases the duration of Overshields and Devour, making it much easier to upkeep the great offensive and defensive benefits these provide.",

This means they won't get killed by them and just unload their damage safely from wherever they are.\n\nOn top of being able to tank everything so well. We are going to be infinitely blinding everything for amazing crowd control. Our rift creates blinding pulses as long as it's on the field and we can get it back in seconds! This includes stunning those pesky unstoppable Champions with those blinding pulses so it takes them out of the fight since the rift lasts so long. Then we add in our Flashbang grenade for a ranged source of blinding that also will jolt everything for us. \n\nWe give infinite arc souls to ourselves and the team which are amplified, so they add a lot of extra damage to everyone on the team. And then we pop a ton of Chaos reach supers adding more jolt and damage and using our hard-hitting heavy weapon to dish out great damage and apply scorch and ignitions. Oh and we still apply unravel to everything and pop out a ton of threadlings for more crowd control and damage. ",

Alongside all that, when doing damage to unraveled targets you also can make threadlings with the artifact perk horde shuttle.\n\nUnravel can come from three different sources. First off is your exotic Swarmers, so when a threadling damages an enemy, they become unraveled. Next is your melee arcane needle, when you use it on an enemy, they become unraveled. Finally, the artifact perk unraveling orbs, when picking up an orb you grant your strand weapon unraveling rounds.\n\nPicking up orbs will also grant you woven mail from the fragment thread of warding.\n\nThreadlings won\u2019t only be able to apply unravel to enemies, but they will also have the ability to travel further and do more damage because of the fragment thread of evolution. On top of that, with the aspect the wanderer, when your threadlings get kills they can make tangles. Alongside that, the wanderer will also allow you to suspend enemies when you destroy the tangle as well.\n\nThe final fragment to round this build out is thread of generation, so when doing any damage, you generate threadling grenade energy. Pairing that with a weapon that can roll with demolitionist means you get a crazy fast grenade recharge rate, which in return means more threadlings.",

    },
    "HowItWorks": "This build is entirely based around dealing DPS. There are a few major points that makes this build deal damage. Lucky Pants, Malfeasance, Apex Predator, applying Jolt, and being Amplified.\n\nLucky Pants and Malfeasance are designed for single target damage. Upon readying Malfeasance, it will receive a 60% damage buff for every shot hit for a 5.5 second duration and caps out at 600% bonus damage. This will stack on top of Surge mods and Malfeasance's catalyst of Vorpal Weapon. You can either run 3 Kinetic Surge mods or 2 Kinetic Surge Mods and 1 Solar Surge mod to also give a damage buff to Apex Predator the other important weapon of the build. Marksman's Dodge will allow you to automatically reload as well as pick up nearby Orbs of Power to fuel the Surge mods with help from the Powerful Attraction mod.\n\nApex Predator is important because it is what you'll be using when Lucky Pants is on cooldown with the Out of Luck debuff. This is a 10 second timeframe which other weapons will be utilized before switching back to Malfeasance. Apex Predator has Bait and Switch which lasts 10 seconds as well (11 w/ Enhanced perk). When Out of Luck occurs, swap to your secondary, shoot one shot, then swap to Apex Predator and use that weapon until Malfeasance/Lucky Pants can be used again.\n\nWhat this subclass adds is the ability to Jolt for extra damage and become Amplified reload very quickly to get the most out of Apex Predator and reload Malfeasance before swapping off of it. Jolt targets with the use of Pulse Grenade with Spark of Shock that has an extended duration from Spark of Magnitude as well as when using the Gathering Storm super. Jolting a target is very important as it adds additional damage for everyone who is shooting the Jolted target. This build can also add even more damage if a teammate is using Witherhoard, as Malfeasance will then deal more damage.\n\nWhen Amplified you'll have quicker ready and reload speeds. Become Amplified by defeating a Jolted target or hitting a target with Disorienting Blow. You can also increase reload speed with just a melee hit from Spark of Frequency.\n\nThe weakness of the build is in its neutral game. Overcome this by playing generally safe and utilizing your one source of survivability and crowd control when you need it most in Disorienting Blow. This melee will Blind the target and make you Amplified as well. Being Amplified adds survivability with the Electric Armor artifact mod for increased damage resistance.",

This is a very offensive build that relies on the melee ability to outright kill targets to refund itself and/or leaving enemies with a small amount of health to be quickly cleaned up. Melee Kickstart mods hasten the melee's cooldown when it does not kill an enemy as a contingency plan. The melee will also kickstart health regeneration due to the Knockout aspect. Survivability is supplemented by Electric Armor from the artifact and Spark of Resistance.\n\nSurvivability is a weak point of this build despite these few means of health regeneration and damage resistance, so be careful in diving head first into harder hitting enemies at lower health. An Insurmountable Skullfort is a good option if you are having difficulty with survivability due to its health regeneration capabilities. This exotic offers a similar playstyle that sacrifices the high damage punches for the ability to punch more often.\n\nWhen using Thunderclap near enemies they will be Jolted. This in turn feeds Pulse Grenade because Spark of Ions will give Ionic Traces for defeating Jolted targets.\n\nPulse Grenade is self sufficient in that it will create Ionic Traces on its own and its cooldown is greatly reduced from the Lightning Strikes Twice mod. The grenade is a great supplement to Thundercrash for high health targets.",

If this is on cooldown, you will have 2 Shackle Grenade charges from the Widow's Silk aspect.\n\nIf an enemy is hit by Shackle Grenade or Ensnaring Slam they will activate the perk in Foetracer which will increase Strand weapon damage. This damage bonus plus the bonus damage of Wish-Keeper hitting Suspended enemies will make it deal 193 damage in the Crucible. This is enough to one-shot low-resilience enemies, but it is enough to kill because Ensnaring Slam and Shackle Grenade deal a small amount of damage. It is important to know that the Suspend from Wish-Keeper does NOT activate Foetracer and does not work with this combo.\n\nThe first fragment of the build are Thread of Continuity to suspend enemies for longer. Next is Thread of Generation to get grenade energy back quicker. Thread of Wisdom to create an Orb of Power on a kill of a suspended enemy. Lastly is Thread of Warding to get Woven Mail when you pick up an Orb of Power. Two Orbs of Power are created if you use Ensnaring Slam and one with Shackle Grenade. Orbs activate Woven Mail, heal from Recuperation, and give ability energy back.",

Good wave clear through the use of the buffed Arc Soul, single target damage with Pulse Grenade and Coldheart, survivability with the Electric Armor seasonal artifact, and crowd control with the blinding of Spark of Beacons and Spark of Brilliance.\n\nThe general rotation of the build involves starting off with a Rift to have access to the highly buffed Arc Soul. Use the Arc Soul, Pulse Grenade, and Coldheart to kill enemies; in which the latter two create Orbs of Power and Ionic Traces. This will supplement ability energy, and with the Powerful Attraction mod, the next Rift used will collect all nearby Orbs of Power allowing you to play safer in cover in a Rift.\n\nThe seasonal artifact mods tie this all together with Coldheart being able to stun Overload Champions, Thunderous Retort increasing super damage, Lightning Strikes Twice increasing grenade uptime, Shock and Awe for spreading Jolt, and Electric Armor for survivability while being Amplified.",

This is countered by the use of Threaded Specter and Threadling Grenades. You will get 2 charges of Threadling Grenades from the Widow's Silk aspect. If an enemy is rushing you down throw a Threadling Grenade at your feet and dodge backwards to create space and spawn a Threaded Specter.\n\nThe Fragment of the build that is mandatory is Thread of Evolution to buff the Threadlings you create. Thread of Generation is nice to have to get more grenades as is Thread of Ascent to have better in-air accuracy when you are backing away from a rushing enemy. The final Fragment is optional and is best used to boost a stat.",

    "HowItWorks": "Becoming invisible is the the starting point of the build. Trapper's Ambush is used because of the ability to make teammates invisible alongside you and grants an extra 2 seconds of invisibility when using Quickfall compared to Vanishing Step. Invisibility is so important because the exotic used, Gyrfalcon's Hauberk gives all of its benefits when performing a finisher while invisible or simply exiting invisibility. When exiting invisibility you will gain Volatile Rounds for your Void Weapons. When performing a finisher while invisible the exotic will give a damage boost and an Overshield to you and nearby allies. The Fragment Echo of Obscurity compliments this well as performing a finisher will make you invisible, allowing this loop to be easily repeated.\n\nThe other Fragments of the build are Echo of Starvation for gaining Devour on an Orb of Power or Void Breach pickup, Echo of Persistence to extend the duration of Overshields, Invisibility, and Devour, and lastly Echo of Harvest to create an Orb of Power and Void Breach on a weakened enemy kill. This final Fragment pairs very well with the Season 21 Artifact mod, Unto the Breach which creates a Void Breach when defeating Void debuffed targets. this effect will occur essentially every 4 seconds as that is the Void Breach's generation cooldown. The other Artifact mod to look at is Protective Breach which will grant a Void Overshield when picking up one of the endless Void Breaches this build creates.\n\nThe general gameplay of this build is to utilize dodge to activate Reaper and reset the cooldown of Snare Bomb, Quickfall or throw Snare Bomb to make yourself and potentially allies invisible, then use a finisher on an enemy to chain invisibility and/or utilize void weapons for the Volatile Rounds they create. Either way you will become invisible once again via Echo of Obscurity or Stylish Executioner. \n\nThis loop will create Orbs of Power and Void Breaches that give armor charge, and the former of which can be collected by dodging because of use of the Powerful Attraction mod. With the full suite of mods and Orbs on the ground, Gambler's Dodge will refund Smoke Bomb, proc Reaper, give a 10% Void weapon damage buff, fully heal you from Recuperation, acquire Devour, and refund grenade energy.",

With Thread of Ascent there is no need to worry about reloading the shotgun, and you can continue this loop until the Grapple Point vanishes.\n\nThe neutral game of this build is also very good in the strength of Frenzied Blade for clearing waves of enemies.

Ideally, the Hand Cannon should have the perk Quickdraw to give it improved ready time to do this as quickly as possible.\n\nIt is important to know that this increase in kinetic damage is from all sources, even teammates. This can be used in team scenarios such as Trials where you can team shot with an enemy to quickly kill an enemy.\n\nThe Dragon's Shadow is the exotic in this build as it further improves Weapon Handling with a scalar, allowing for even quicker swapping on top of Quickdraw.\n\nAs mentioned before this can work with any Class and abilities, but Solar Hunter is chosen as its ability to use The Dragon's Shadow and it being able to cover those rushing you down with Throwing Knives. This build's weakness is in its close-range capabilities, and Throwing Knives paired with a Bow and Hand Cannon shot help cover this weakness.",

So this means strand titans have the best End game boss killer build, and the best area of effect, Add killer Build.\n\nThe other build that comes to mind when talking AOE Add killer is the Sunbracer Solar Warlock that has reigned supreme for a while. But I really do think this build pushes stands toe to toe with the SunLock.\n\nYou have a x4 Banner of war for Healing on Titan and x2 Restoration on a Warlock.\nBanner heals the entire team whereas Restoration only heals the Warlock.\nBanner gives Melee damage increase which includes our Grapple Melee and our 3 charges of Frenzied Blade. Warlock gets an Ignition proc off their Melee.\nNow our punch can clear an entire room but so can a Sunbracer warlock with those Solar grenades.\n\nBut I think the most important thing is the ease of use of the Strand Titan. It's a single grapple punch. That's it, The punch procs Banner of war and can easily hit a X3 or x4 in a single punch. It procs our melee damage increase, It procs our Woven Mail as well because our grapple punch creates 2 Orbs of Power off every punch! I thought Bungie said that was no longer possible quite a while back but it definitely is!\n\nWhereas the ease of use of Sunbracers is a bit harder to get the loop down and yes some people struggle with it and that's perfectly fine! Not everyone is a god tier gamer like I know some of you are going to say in the comments that sunbracers are so easy to plunder. \n\nAnd the last thing I want to point out is that this Build is well self-sustained from the Mods and Subclass that any weapons will work with it. I ran it with a ton of different options like Monte Carlo for more Melee ability, Bloodline to add Devour to the Build which is just insane, Quicksilver Storm to play into Strand more and even Dragon's Breach for Solar Ignitions to add to the mix. Point is with not requiring a certain weapon\nit opens up the Playstyle to whatever fits you best, heck you could add a 1 2 Punch shotty if you wanted too.",

Next, Abeyant Leap will transform your aspect drengr\u2019s lash to shoot out three lashes when you place your class ability to suspend enemies. Finally, your shackle grenade will have the ability to suspend enemies. With that, you have two abilities and your weapon able to suspend.\n\nTo keep those abilities up and running, the fragment thread of mind will grant you class ability energy upon killing a suspended enemy. This will work from any source of suspend that is listed above. Next is thread of generation, so any time you deal damage from any source, you generate shackle grenade energy. Suspend will even last longer from every source because of the fragment thread of continuity. \n\nFor survivability, the aspect into the fray will grant you woven mail whenever you destroy a tangle near you or pop your super. You can also be granted woven mail whenever you suspend a target with your exotic Abeyant Leap. Finally, whenever you pick up an orb, you are also granted woven mail because of the fragment thread of warding. While woven mail is active from any of these you will also generate frenzied blade energy so you can sever targets more often.\n\nYour artifact will also be able to grant you unraveling rounds when picking up an orb. Pairing that with horde shuttle when you deal damage to the unraveled targets, you can spawn threadlings for additional damage. Finally, with dragon\u2019s bite, when you break a shield with Wish-Keeper, you have a chance to suspend them, which will be the fourth and final way of suspending.\n\nSince you can spam your class ability a lot, taking armor mods like dynamo for extra super energy or bomber for extra grenade energy is also extremely nice.",

Skip Grenades are buffed immensely by Shinobu's Vow and they will grant an additional grenade charge, increase their projectile count from 4 to 5, improve their tracking, and refund 10% of grenade energy for every projectile hit. This final point will refund half of a Skip Grenade's cooldown if all 5 projectiles hit. The rest of the build will fill in that other half through a few other means.\n\nThe first of those is through Ionic Traces, these refund 12.5% of grenade energy and are created when killing a jolted enemy thanks to Spark of Ions. Enemies are jolted by Skip Grenades with the Fragment Spark of Shock. Grenade kills and kills after dodging will create Orbs of Power. The initial dodge will give grenade energy from Bomber, and collecting these will in turn refund grenade energy with the Innervation mod. Orbs also have the added bonus of healing with Recuperation. The final boost to grenade energy is from 2 Grenade Kickstart mods. These mods utilize the extra armor charged from Stacks on Stacks and will refund roughly 50% of grenade energy with 4 stacks of armor charge.\n\nIf grenade is not available, this build can always fall back on the Combination Blow and Gambler's Dodge arc hunter combo. With Lethal Current you'll be able to chain together a dodge then a melee to build up stacks of increased melee damage, have dodge and Combination Blow refund one another on use, jolt enemies, and blind jolted enemies. Lastly when killing a jolted enemy you will become Amplified from Flow State.\n\nThe Fragment Spark of Amplitude takes advantage of being Amplified and will create an Orb of Power with rapid kills while Amplified. The final Fragment Spark of Resistance gives a 25% damage resistance buff when near 3 or more enemies. This final Fragment can potentially be replaced with Spark of Recharge for even better grenade recharge if the damage resistance is not needed.\n\nThe weapons of the build are quite flexible as this is a very ability dependent build. One recommendation is to utilize weapons with the Demolitionist perk. This compliments the build very well as Demolitionist weapon kills give grenade energy, and throwing a grenade will automatically reload the weapon.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Utilize Skip Grenade to jolt enemies and create Orbs of Power on kills\nRefund remaining grenade cooldown by collecting Orbs of Power, getting kills with Demolitionist weapons, and utilizing dodge\nContinue throwing grenades utilizing the armor charges to fuel Grenade Kickstart\nIf grenades are not available utilize the dodge and Combination Blow melee cycle"

Either rocket can be used in this build, just be sure to match the 2 or 3 Weapon Surge mods on your boots to the element of the rocket.\n\nThis build maximizes the ability of these rockets to output damage by utilizing Radiant Dance Machines in combination with Marksman's Dodge. Radiant Dance Machines allows you to continuously dodge which will proc Marksman's Dodge and reload the currently equipped weapon. At its base form the multi-dodge lasts for 5 seconds, but getting a kill will extend it to 10 seconds.\n\nDuring a damage phase use Witherhoard and your energy weapon to start the Bait and Switch activation, then dodge to activate Radiant Dance Machines' multi-dodge and collect nearby Orbs of Power with Powerful Attraction to fuel Weapon Surge mods.. Next get a kill with Knife Trick on a nearby low health enemy that should be left alive before the damage phase. This will grant both the Radiant buff and extend Radiant Dance Machines' timer to 10 seconds. This coincides with the Bait and Switch timer on Apex Predator which should be drawn after landing the Knife Trick kill.\n\nFrom here continue to shoot Apex Predator and dodge to completely circumvent reloading the weapon as it has a 35% damage boost from Bait and Switch, plus Radiant's 25% damage bonus, and the 17% or 22% damage bonus from 2 or 3 Weapon Surge mods.",

All while gaining Volatile rounds as well to create these great purple and green explosions that are so satisfying to see. But what makes it even better is we have a super available for every single group of enemies if we choose to use it thanks to not needing Gyrfalcons anymore and using Orpheus Rig. \n\nOur Shadowshot adds a 30% weaken  and Suppresses everything it touches which allows us to go to town with our weapons and abilities to trigger everything! You also will create so many Orbs of Power and Void breaches that when you're done killing a wave they will be left lying all over the ground. \n\nYou start by throwing your smoke bomb at a single enemy. Then kill that enemy with your weapon. So this one kill triggers everything. That Kill will make you go invisible because of Stylish executioner. We then move to where we kill that weakened enemy and grab the Orb of Power and the Void Breach that the single kill created thanks to Echo of Harvest, where defeating weakened targets creates both for us. \n\nWe now have procd Devour thanks to Echo of Starvation where picking up either one will activate it. Now you position yourself somewhere to fire off a few shots with your strand weapon. This will apply the unravel debuff for us! Once you apply Unravel, throw your Vortex grenade, this will group up the enemies, cause damage which will proc, and spread Unravel to all the enemies. \n\nTry and let your Vortex grenade get one kill so we can proc Volatile rounds for 10 seconds. Then switch to your Bloodline and go to town with it. Using your heavy machine gun when needed to proc Repulsor Brace as well for Void Overshields. I can\u2019t stress enough on how powerful this Void Hunter Build is and once you get it down you will never have a better time playing Destiny 2 right now. ",

    "HowItWorks": "The goal of this build is to freeze everything on the battlefield.\n\nWith Osmiomancy Gloves, you are going to get two coldsnap grenade charges that can be used as stasis turrets or normal grenades. Both of these will freeze enemies efficiently, and direct impacts with the normal coldsnap will grant grenade energy back.\n\nWith Verglas Curve, getting kills will load stasis arrows, which can be used to freeze enemies or make crystals. The crystals that are made from this can also freeze enemies, and getting kills with them will load even more stasis arrows.\n\nFor aspects, taking iceflare bolts is a must because when you shatter frozen targets, you will spawn seekers that can go out and freeze more enemies. Since everything in your build can freeze, this just means you are getting double the value. To make the stasis turrets mentioned earlier, you will need to run the bleak watcher aspect. With this, you can hold down your grenade button to convert it.\n\nFor fragments whisper of fissures is great since you are freezing everything and making crystals. This means you will do more damage with the shatter and it will have a bigger explosion. The next fragment is whisper of shards, so when you destroy a stasis crystal, you will get 500% grenade regen. Having more grenades means more turrets and more freezing. Whisper of chains is very strong for your survivability because you will get 40% damage reduction when standing near frozen targets or crystals. The final fragment is whisper of rending, so your primary weapon does more damage to frozen targets and crystals. This will make Verglas Curve pretty decent at doing single-target damage in harder activities and you can destroy crystals easier with it.\n\nFor artifact perks, hail the storm is great because when destroy a crystal, you spawn slowing shards that go out and damage enemies. On top of that, shattering them or frozen targets will do more damage, which pairs well with whisper of fissures. The next main perk is pillar of ice, so when you defeat a frozen target, you will spawn a stasis crystal. \n\nEvery single frozen target or stasis crystal you make from all of this will synergize and play into your subclass.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Throw a grenade or turret to start freezing enemies\nGet kills with your bow to load stasis arrows\nUse those to make crystals to destroy for grenade recharge\nStand near frozen targets or crystals for damage reduction\nRepeat this for ad clear and the additional benefits"

    "HowItWorks": "This Void Warlock Build truly encompasses what Destiny 2 Builds should be all about. Thanks to a few new weapons in Season of the Wish and a couple of mod changes, we now have a VoidLock Grenade build that dips into 3 different subclasses while still maintaining that classic VoidLock feel and providing us with infinite grenades that hit harder that a x5 Dragon\u2019s Breath rocket! \n\nOur Strand Fusion Rifle applies the Sever and Unravel debuffs along with now creating threadlings. Our Void Bow allows for infinite Void Overshields and Volatile Rounds, we also get a 50% damage buff on this bow pretty much 24/7 so we don\u2019t need surge mods on the boots. Then our Solar Heavy rocket launcher applies Scorch and Ignitions for us on any target. Plus if we get a multi-kill with it, which is easy thanks to the ignitions, it will make us radiant thanks to an artifact mod. \n\nFrom our VoidWalker subclass we get access to Weaken and Devour, so everything is debuffed by 15% and we get a full heal on every kill thanks to the improved devour on the Feed the Void Aspect along with grenade energy on every single kill. Then to top it off our Vortex grenades hit harder than Dragon\u2019s Breath and can create multiple orbs of power per grenade. Since we can generate an orb every second now with a Grenade and these orbs will give us 25% energy to our Grenade ability every time we pick one up. \n\nSo just to name off exactly what you get when this Build is played right, a grenade that hits harder than an Exotic Rocket Launcher and this list of Buffs & Debuffs! Enjoy Guardian! Weaken, Volatile Rounds. Devour, Void Overshield, Unravel, Sever, Threadlings, Scorch, Ignitions and Radiant.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Throw your Vortex Grenade to proc Devour.\nSlay out using our Void Bow to proc Verity\u2019s Brow, Repulsor Brace, and Devour.\nPick up any Orb of Power for 25% Grenade energy.\nAs soon as your grenade is back, Use it. You should have 5 Stacks of Veritys at this point.\nUse your Strand Fusion to occasionally apply the Sever and Unravel Debuffs.\nUse your grenade every 5 seconds or so and keep firing that bow!\nUse your Dragon\u2019s Breath for Boss damage and combine it with the Strand debuffs and your Vortex grenade that hits as hard as your Dragon\u2019s breath."

The reason for this is we have 5 sources of on demand Ignitions and you all know how strong Ignitions are. They are room clearing explosions and when combined with revitalizing blast and solo operative when your're solo, that adds a 30% damage buff to all these Ignitions and since we have so many on demand, that's what makes the combo truly powerful this season and even when your not solo, you're still getting the bonus from revitalizing blast and the infinite 400% ability regen for our healing grenade and dodge ability.\n\nNow the harder content you push the more our knife trick melee starts to fall off, you have to be really close to land all the knives and they normally won't kill in master or Grandmaster content. So we go with a weighted throwing knife instead because hitting a scorched target will cause an ignition. With this season's artifact any Solar weapon we choose will be able to scorch targets thanks to the mod. We're always radiant from our knives so this is easy. Our knife is now a guaranteed ignition and we can scorch a target and hit them with our knife from a safe distance in difficult content. Next we add in gunpowder gamble. Which would make the 5th ignition to the overall build. We also have this available all the time as we are getting so many ignition kills from the 4 knives.",

    "HowItWorks": "Titans can spam Fusion Grenades too! Ashen Wake lets solar Titans throw endless Fusion Grenades by refunding grenade energy on kill. Fusion Grenades will also instantly explode on impact. Grenade energy is refunded based on the enemy type that is defeated with a grenade, from Grenade Kickstart mods, and from picking up Orbs of Power that are created from grenade via Firepower, kills after casting Barricade via Reaper, and 2 solar weapon kills via Solar Siphon. With all these avenues of grenade regeneration, you will be able to continuously throw Fusion Grenades on demand.\n\nGrenade kills will create Orbs of Power from Firepower, create Sunspots which gives Restoration, and builds up to 3 stacks of Roaring Flames which increases ability damage. If Fusion Grenade is not available, Throwing Hammer is a great alternative to use in the meantime. It will create Sunspots, grant the Radiant buff for a 25% weapon damage boost, and maintain Roaring Flames as well. Sunspots are fantastic for healing and regenerating abilities faster. \n\nGetting a solar weapon or ability kill will extend the timer for Restoration and Radiant with Ember of Empyrean, allowing for continuous healing and improved weapon damage. Allies will also receive the Radiant buff, which gives the extra bonus of 200% ability regeneration rate from Ember of Benevolence. Ability regeneration is further supplemented by Ember of Searing creating Firesprites when defeating Scorched enemies, which when picked up reduce cooldowns.\n\nThe weapon of the build are best with the Incandescent perk. This will ensure the weapon is solar so it activates Ember of Empyrean, and it will scorch targets to activate Ember of Searing to create Firesprites.",

    "HowItWorks": "The Stasis Warlock in Season of the Wish has to be the best version of the Stasis Lock that I have ever seen. It has always excelled at crowd control and freezing entire rooms of enemies, but this season it got a couple buffs and we can actually add damage to the build for once to make it the best of both worlds!\n\nWe combine several different subclasses like Solar and Strand to make this Build but in the most work it's ever been able to do and I think you guys will be really surprised with how this build performs for you!\n\nThere are 3 Key things that we need to cover in order for you to experience this Build at its full potential.\n\nThe first thing is weapon choice because they play a big part in this build, we want to take Strand and Solar weapons to make this build into something special and there are 2\ndifferent ways to go about this. You either take a Strong Strand weapon that will do the bulk of the work for you, or a strong Solar weapon as your main and the secondary strand weapon as a way to just apply debuffs. I found the best route was to take a strand weapon as my primary because I have just been playing with sunshot way too much this season. So I would go with Quicksilver Storm like you're seeing in most of the Gameplay, This thing hits like a truck and when you pair our freezing capabilities and freeze a ton of enemies, the Grenade launcher form can clear out mobs of enemies at once and really makes you feel powerful when this happens!\n\nSome other honorable mentions are The Navigator, I used it in a run of the Coil and being able to apply woven mail and also sever the high health targets were great! So if you have this weapon try it out! Final warning is also a great option and is Anti barrier and then a great Legendary is Rufus's Fury.\n\nNow that weapons are out of the way let's talk about 2 Fragments because you need to choose between 45% more damage or 40% more survivability based on the activity you are doing! The other 3 fragments will stay the same and the 4th is chosen between Whisper of Chains that grants us 40% damage reduction when were near Stasis Crystals or Frozen targets and then Whisper of Rending that allows our primary weapon to hit Frozen targets 45% harder. So on something like the grenade form of Quicksilver, you are doing massive damage to anything frozen. So in easier activities I would take Rending, but in harder ones I would switch to Chains.\n\nThe last thing is our Artifact mod choices and how we play into those! The first 2 are the Stasis mods Pillar of Ice and Hail the Storm. What these do is cause our Shatter damage from frozen targets and stasis crystals to hit harder for roughly a 15% damage buff for both. When we kill encased targets, they will spawn a Stasis Crystal for us. This is huge as now we have a way to spawn crystals without Headstone or glacial grenade. \n\nThe next 2 mods are Unraveling Orbs and Horde Shuttle. When we pick up an Orb of power this allows our strand weapons to apply the unravel debuff which again is just added damage on a target and while we're damaging a unraveled target, Threadlings will pop off them and either damage that same enemy or seek out another. Once again this is just more overall damage to anything! We also take the 2 Solar mods for Radiant and Scorch but these aren't as important if you have chosen the strand route, But if you're using the Navigator for example like I was, then my secondary was Zailou's Bane and I would have Radiant up quite often for my weapons! Then Switch to The Navigator to apply the strand debuffs and buffs.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Use your Rift; This is to proc Reaper and help with survivability\nUse your Coldsnap or Stasis turret to freeze everything!\nGrab the orb of power and go to town with your strand weapon\nThis will get your class ability back thanks to the fragment Whisper of Refraction\nYour weapon spreads Unravel and Threadlings to everything\nUse your grenades as needed and the grenade launcher form of Quicksilver storm"

The gameplay loop above explains how we can always have any ability available and we pair all of this with the Exotic Precious Scars. \n\nThis will give us Restoration on a Stasis Titan, making it much more viable now since it always missed that healing source! If you're looking for a different way to play Destiny 2 during this long season of the wish then give this build a shot and I know you won\u2019t be disappointed! ",

When possible, shoot the central crystal to increase grenade regeneration rate from Whisper of Shards. Whisper of Torment will also help get Duskfield back passively. The general use case of these grenades are to zone off areas of the map and objectives such as revives or capture points, slow down and bait enemies pushing you, force enemies out of cover and away from Rifts and Barricades.\n\nMask of Bakris is what makes this build akin to guerilla warfare. The shift this exotic provide lets you quickly engage or disengage into a fight. With the Winter's Shroud Aspect enemeis will be slowed when class ability is used near them. Use this to get an advantage in fights or even freeze enemies who already have slow stacks from Duskfield Grenade.\n\nThe most important portion of the build is Cryosthesia 77K. In its base form this sidearm is fantastic, and after a kill a frozen bullet can be loaded to freeze an enemy, setting up an easy kill. Cryosthesia can be used for kills on frozen enemies as Whisper of Rending is used, increasing the damage primary ammo weapons do to frozen targets. Letting you set up another frozen bullet.",

We're already an offensive Juggernaut with our Slam and damage bonus from roaring flames, but we can now shoot our weapon and get a kill, that's it, which instantly activates all 3 of these buffs, a 400% ability regen that's up infinitely. Radiant for a 25% damage buff on all our weapons, and you guessed it, infinitely. Then apply restoration to ourselves and extend it infinitely just by our weapon! Then to add the cherry on top we're applying restoration to the entire fireteam and doing this endlessly to boost survivability for everyone! Just imagine how much you can help your team, while still dishing out the damage yourself with infinite abilities and everything is triggered by shooting your weapon and getting 1 single kill.\n\nI hope my point is clear on how strong I think this build is and the potential it has on your fireteam!\n\nWe start off by taking Burning Maul because it's the best super when we don't have sunspots to extend our throwing hammers. Choose the offensive grenade of your choice, not the healing grenade that you see in most Solar builds. I like the thermite grenade personally for ignition procs. We then take roaring flames so our abilities do massive damage and add clear and the second aspect is the Consecration Slam! This thing is so powerful if used right and has always been one of my favorite abilities since its release.\n\nNow Fragments are really important in what they do so pay attention\n\nSearing for melee energy on every single kill\nTorches for radiant for the fireteam\nEmpyrean for infinite restoration and radiant for yourself.\nBenevolence for a 400% ability regen that will be active 24/7 since we're applying restoration 24/7 to the entire fireteam.\n\nFor weapons take a strong Solar weapon. This is key to make the build feel smoother.\n\nFor exotic we take precious scars and yes I know it looks hideous, but the good outweighs the bad here. This grants you restoration and your fireteam restoration every 3 seconds on a kill with a weapon matching your subclass! This has a 15 meter reach in any direction so it reaches far, we extend restoration ourselves through Empyrean and just kill a enemy every 6 seconds or so to keep re-proc'ing ember of benevolence. In between the weapon kills we use the powerful Slam and grenade that gets boosted by roaring flames so they hit hard then we continue to shoot our weapon and kill enemies like normal! ",

The interaction between Gambler's Dodge and Combination Blow is most important to learn. Gambler's Dodge will refill Combination Blow when near an enemy, and defeating a target with Combination Blow will completely refill Gambler's Dodge energy.\n\nThe benefits of using a melee on an enemy are plenty. The first is tied in an Aspect, Lethal Current, which is activated after dodging and increases melee lunge distance, Jolts, and creates an aftershock that damages nearby enemies. The exotic Assassin's Cowl makes melee kills and finishers restore some health and grants invisibility. Mods will make melee kills create Orbs of Power as well as replenish super and grenade energy.\n\nThe other two abilities in the build, Gathering Storm and Pulse Grenade, are nothing to scoff at. Gathering Storm is a very strong single target damage super, and Pulse Grenade is strong in its own right, but is extended with Spark of Magnitude and Jolts targets with Spark of Shock. Be sure to utilize these abilities when possible.\n\nThe last bit of the build is in weapons. Using a shotgun with One-Two Punch will increase melee damage even further, and is strongly recommended in this build. The other two options are quite flexible. With Combination Blow being the primary means in which enemies are damaged, using two special weapons is best, and the other slot can be occupied by Witherhoard, Arbalest, a Trace Rifle, or a grenade launcher. Using two special weapons will also create more heavy bricks for the heavy weapon of your choice.",

Solar Weapon Surges on our leg armor will also carry your damage to new heights as well!",

Radar manipulation will give you a jump in fights and can be done by throwing a Snare Bomb to create a ping on the enemy radar. The other is going invisible after throwing a Snare Bomb via dodging and Vanishing Step. This plays perfectly with Reaper as the means to activate this mod is the same as the means to get an upper hand in fights which is dodging and going invisible. FR0ST-EES will make these tools available more often by improving grenade and melee recharge rate by 100% and 200% dodge regeneration rate when sprinting.\n\nThe mods will only add fuel to the fire with the use of multiple Void unflinching, targeting, and weapon surge. The first two will be active at all the time and increase the ease of use of Wavesplitter. Feel free to swap the third targeting and unflinching mods based on the element of your kinetic slot weapon. The weapon surge mods will increase the damage of Wavesplitter even more when picking up an Orb of Power, so use as many as possible. This bonus damage effect is extended by the use of 2 Time Dilation mods.",

In order to do this prioritize using abilities in the order in which you care about them from least to most. To get the most out of grenades, use class ability, then melee, and finally the grenade. This way Pulse Grenade will have the best buff when they are used.\n\nPulse Grenades will create Ionic Traces for ability regeneration from Touch of Thunder, Jolt targets from Spark of Shock, and last longer from Spark of Magnitude. On top of those buffs, the mods are based around the grenade via Firepower for making Orbs of Power, Bolstering Detonation and Momentum Transfer for class/melee energy on grenade hits, and Bomber and Innervation for grenade energy when using Barricade or picking up orbs. Seismic Strike has the utility of blinding Enemies which can handle Unstoppable Champions. As for class ability, if the content is easier, Thruster is a viable option because of its cooldown. Otherwise Barricade is the safer play.\n\nThe two weapons to have are Thunderlord and a Void energy weapon. Thunderlord is a jack of all trades and can create Ionic Traces with Spark of Discharge.",

The survivability and damage together are the biggest things we need since we will be somewhat close for the melees that we need to kill enemies with to cause the Severance Explosion for us! \n\nThe entire Build is pretty simple at its core. It requires you to ramp up your Roaring Flames by getting solar ability kills, we only need 3 of these. Next, we throw our mini hammer or use our regular melee because it\u2019s considered a powered melee thanks to the roaring flames buff.

Penumbral Blast will freeze a target when hit. Healing Rift paired with Frostpulse will freeze enemies nearby when casting Rift. And of course Shadebinder will be able to freeze enemies as well. All of these freezing sources are enhanced by Iceflare Bolts which will chain freeze enemies near a frozen enemy that was shattered.\n\nThere are two exotic weapons that can be used with this build. The choice is based on preference and availability. The first is Conditional Finality which is adds another freezing source to the build and will be able to kill multiple frozen enemies in close proximity. The other is J\u00f6tunn which is better for landing longer range kills on frozen enemies. Whichever you choose use the equipped exotic to easily clean up enemies frozen from abilities and send Iceflare Bolts to other enemies.\n\nThe mods of the build are geared towards returning grenade energy quickly with Bomber and Grenade Kickstart as well as buffing the primary weapon in use. Be sure to change the Unflinching, Targeting, Loader and Surge mods to match the element of the primary weapon that is in use.",

    "HowItWorks": "The goal of this build is to never die and have restoration at all times.\n\nThis can be achieved because of your exotic Karnstein Armlets and its recent buff. Getting a melee kill or finisher will cure you and apply restoration. You can keep the restoration up with ember of empyrean, so with each solar weapon or ability kill, it will extend the timer. While this is up or when you proc your cure, you are pretty much unkillable. Remember, Karnstein can also reproc the restoration and always apply the cure on every melee kill or finisher.\n\nWith this build, you can also spam your abilities to help keep you alive and do massive damage. With ember of singeing every time you scorch an enemy, you will be granted increased class ability regeneration. Taking phoenix dive is the play because you can have an instant cure to help keep you alive, and it comes back almost immediately. With ember of searing, every scorch target you defeat will grant you melee energy and create a firesprite. Picking up the firesprites will grant you grenade energy, and you can further increase this by taking the mod innervation, so picking up orbs will also grant grenade energy.\n\nHaving your abilities is great because you can apply debuffs to bosses with the artifact perk revitalizing blast. Other perks to help out are flint striker so you can always be radiant alongside restoration and kindling trigger so your solar weapons can apply scorch to targets. These will stack with everything else we went over.\n\nFor aspects, touch of flame is a must so your fusion grenade can explode twice to deal massive damage. Icarus dash is also very nice for mobility to get out of any sticky situation you might be in. The final fragment is ember of ashes to apply more scorch stacks from everything in this build. Finally, running a heavy ammo finder is almost a must for solo content, and your Sunshot will be able to make a ton for you since it\u2019s exotic.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Get a melee kill or finisher on an enemy to cure and restoration\nKeep restoration up by getting kills with Sunshot or your abilities.\nBe aware that you can reapply restoration on a non-powered melee kill and finisher and also grant cure\nLook for ammo to proc overflow on both your weapons.\nLook out for orbs and firesprites to refill your grenade energy\nUse your abilities on bosses to apply a debuff"

Peacekeepers amplifies the efficacy of the SMGs by reloading them when stowed, readying them instantly, improves handling, improves movement speed when wielding one, and increases airborne effectiveness with them."
      }
    },
    "HowItWorks": "This build has quite a few things going for it. First Titans are the best class for utilizing The Immortal and other strong Submachine Guns because of the Peacekeepers. Second is Thundercrash is the best shutdown super in the game and has a lower cooldown. Lastly, Arc Titan has the means to buff and gets two charges of Lightning Grenades.\n\nIn terms of weapons paired with Peacekeepers, The Immortal is the recommended smg to use with this build. The smg to use is based on availability and preference, but some alternative options are the Ikelos smg, Tarrabah, Shayura's Wrath, and The Title. For the weapon to pair with an smg, there are quite a few options. A sniper would be good to balance out range, a wave frame grenade launcher to weaken enemies to close in on, or a shotgun can be used for full-on close-quarter aggression.\n\nThe abilities to build around are Barricade and Lightning Grenades. Barricade is great for taking map control, shutting off choke points, and securing objectives, revives, and heavy ammo. Lightning Grenades are great for forcing enemies off of areas. With Touch of Thunder, two charges are granted, and the initial blast will Jolt enemies and can lead to chaining multiple kills from just one grenade. Lightning Grenades can be built into even more by substituting Spark of Feedback with Spark of Shock so any hit with a Lightning Grenade will Jolt a target.\n\nThe neutral game is rounded out with the melee ability, which is buffed by Knockout and the Spark of Feedback Fragment. With the use of Submachine Guns, being in melee range is common, and once an opponent's shield is broken, Knockout activates, which will increase melee lunge distance, melee damage to 150, and start health regeneration on a melee kill. With Spark of Feedback active, melee damage increases to 150 after being hit with a melee or breaking a shield. This means landing just a couple smg shots instead of a double melee will win any double melee fight rather than trade.\n\nFinally Thundercrash tops off the build as it can shut down Ward of Dawn and Well of Radiance in objective capturing or any roaming super. Thundercrash has a low cooldown time which will ensure it is available before most other supers.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Utilize Barricade for map control\nZone an area off using Lightning Grenades\nFinish enemies who are Jolted and damaged with The Immortal\nUtilize Seismic Strike to quickly escape or change directions if needed"

With the launch of Lightfall it has actually gotten a lot better thanks to the Slam being able to create Firesprites and Orbs of Power. \n\nBoth of which feed the overall ability loop because Firesprites give grenade energy and the Orb of Power gives all ability energy on top of feeding armor charges for the Melee Kickstart mod. It is one big ability loop that has the best destructive power feeling you will find in Destiny 2.",

On top of that, if you land a precision kill, you will also proc an ignition, which pairs well with Sunshot\u2019s exotic trait for insane ad clear. This is because of rays of precision.\n\nDefeating scorched targets will make sunspots due to the aspect sol invictus. Sunspots will grant you restoration and faster ability cooldowns while also dealing even more scorch damage to enemies. The radiant (from above) and restoration provided can be easily kept up because every kill you get will add time due to the fragment ember of empyrean. \n\nThe other aspect, consecration, will let you turn your melee into a wave of scorch damage that you can slam down on to ignite. With your exotic Pyrogale Gauntlets, you will also make a cyclone on the second impact that can do more damage. With Pyrogale, you will also change your burning maul to be a one-slam super that does way more damage and then makes even more cyclones. Heart of the flame can also buff your super damage when teammates are around on cast.\n\nWith all the scorch in this build, taking advantage of ember of singeing for faster class ability cooldown is a must. Ember of searing will also grant you melee energy on defeating scorch targets which is nice to get consecration back faster. With that, you will also make firesprites that can refill your healing grenade. Then if you go back to sunspots you will get even more ability regeneration paired with everything here.\n\nThe final things to help the build out are things like ember of ashes to apply more scorch to enemies. Since you can spam your class ability taking dynamo for even more super energy is also very nice. Finally, a heavy ammo finder paired with Sunshot is also very good with the amount of easy kills you will be getting.",

We add in Ember of Singeing which means we can always get our rift back infinitely because this fragment gives us a 300% increase in class ability regen! \n\nSo when we shoot a rocket off and switch to our Special for damage. We are getting that class ability back and our rocket is auto-loaded thanks to the Ignitions going off since we added in Dawn Chorus and Ember of Ashes.The Daybreak Super hits hard with Dawn Chorus. So you pop your rift, shoot off a Rocket, pop your super and throw all your blades. \n\nThen when you come out of your super, fire off another rocket and switch to your special. By the time the 2 rockets are done damaging you will have your rift back. This allows infinite healing on any damage phase. So when you're trying to solo flawless something this build will make it 10 times easier for you. No crazy ability rotation or weapon rotation for bait and switch or anything. We also never swap Builds or Exotic Armor. It\u2019s a great simple Build!",

This allows these knives to be thrown on demand at all times. As a final means of getting melee energy back, One-Two Finisher will grant melee energy on a finisher and Invigoration will do so when picking up an Orb of Power. \n\nWith Ember of Ashes, landing all 3 knives in Knife Trick will apply 90 Scorch stacks and will increase weapon damage through the Radiant buff from Ember of Torches. A second Knife Trick or a weapon that generates Scorch will then cause an Ignition.\n\nWith double Hands-On mods, Blade Barrage, one of the highest damage and fastest charging supers in the game will be available often. The other ability in use Healing Grenade, is there for added survivability. Paired with Ember of Empyrean, a Knife Trick kill or solar weapon final blow will extend the timers of Restoration from Healing Grenade and Radiant.

    "HowItWorks": "The goal of this build is to spread scorch everywhere and cause ignitions all the time.\n\nOur scorch damage will be buffed due to our exotic Dawn Chorus while also granting us melee energy per scorch tick. On top of that, your super will do more damage and apply scorch as well. With our exotic weapon, Polaris Lance getting 4 precision hits, will load a 5th shot that explodes and applies scorch. If you are running the kindling trigger artifact perk shooting an enemy will apply scorch while radiant, and then once the Polaris Lance explosion procs you will get an ignite. This is extremely nice because you essentially get an ignite every five shots from your exotic weapon.\n\nIgnites are going to be extremely common because of that and because of the artifact perk rays of precision. Now while radiant, every precision kill you get will cause an ignite as well. Taking the fragment ember of char means that ignition will also apply scorch just like your Polaris Lance explosion. This will lead to ever more chaining ignites and massive scorch damage.\n\nTo be radiant at all times, the artifact perk flint striker will allow you to become radiant when getting rapid precision hits or solar weapon kills. This is nice because of how you are going to be using Polaris Lance. The fragment ember of empyrean will also help keep radiant up because you only need to get a solar weapon or ability kill to extend the timer. This is also nice because our healing grenade will apply restoration to us, and this will be extended as well because of the fragment. To buff the healing grenade, we'll take the aspect touch of flame for more cure and even stronger restoration.\n\nArtifact perks like heart of the flame are nice to grant allies and yourself radiant while also increasing your super damage when you pop your super. This pairs nicely with Dawn Chorus. The final artifact perk is revitalizing blast, so your solar abilities can apply a debuff to bosses and champions.\n\nThen the final things to round the build-out are going to be ember of ashes, so all the scorch stacks we apply will apply more. This leads to faster ignites and more damage. Since we will scorch everything the fragment ember of searing is nice because we will now make firesprites and grant even more melee energy. \n\nA final cool note is that if you run something with the chill clip perk, you have access to stun every champion. Chill clip will slow which stuns overload, radiant will stun barrier, and ignites can stun unstoppable champions.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Get multiple precision final blows to proc radiant\nGet multiple precision kills to proc ignites and spread scorch\nRapidly hit bosses or champs with precision hits to proc your scorch explosion\nThis explosion, paired with your scorch from kindling trigger, will cause an ignite\nUse your buffed super on any boss for massive damage"

      }
    },
    "HowItWorks": "This is a heavy utility build focused on keeping you alive while slowing, freezing, and shattering enemies. With its freezing capabilities, this build can handle champions without the use of anti-champion weapons.\n\nDuskfield Grenade is the primary ability to look at. This grenade has its duration increased from 7 to 9 seconds with Whisper of Durance, will apply a 6 second freeze to enemies in its area for 1 second, and has a larger area plus a Stasis Crystal in the center with the Touch of Winter Aspect. This ability will lockdown the battlefield and be available often due to the use of Whisper of Shards which increases its regeneration rate by 500% for 6 seconds when destroying a Stasis Crystal. This effect is doubled while sprinting due to the use of FR0ST-EES. The use of FR0ST-EES will reduce the cooldowns of abilities immensely due to how often sprint is used in general play.\n\nThe build also makes use of the Whisper of Chains Fragment which will give 40% damage resistance when 10 meters or less from a Stasis Crystal. Duskfield Grenade gives this because of the Stasis Crystal it creates, which makes the grenade both offensive and defensive. This effect can also be activated through weapons with Headstone or being near any target that is frozen from abilities.\n\nWithering Blade is another means of easily freezing targets as it applies 60 stacks of slow, and Revenant carries two charges of this ability. Both charges can be thrown to immediately freeze any target. Due to the strength of this mechanic, Gambler's Dodge is opted for to recover a charge of Withering Blade on a Dodge near an enemy. The other main means in which this cooldown is supplemented is by the use of the Grim Harvest Aspect which creates Stasis Shards when defeating Slowed or Frozen targets and gives melee energy when they are collected. These shards will also give healing and shields from the Whisper of Rime Fragment.\n\nThe mods and stats are the last bits of the build to look at. Due to the use of Whisper of Hedrons, freezing an enemy gives a 60 point increase to mobility, resilience, and recovery as well as weapon usability buffs for 11 seconds. This allows you to prioritize other stats as many opponents will be frozen when utilizing this build.\n\nThe mods of the build creates an Orb of Power for the first kill after dodging from Reaper. An orb will give energy to all three abilities, start health regeneration, and will fuel Grenade Kickstart through Armor Charges, giving grenade energy on its next use. For the other mods in use be sure to match the Siphon and Reserve mods with the weapons that are used.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Throw a Duskfield Grenade to lockdown an area with Freeze and Slow effects\nKill frozen enemies to create Stasis Shards from Grim Harvest and to proc shatter AoE damage to destroy the small stasis crystal to gain 500% grenade regeneration rate from Whisper of Shards\nSprint towards the Stasis Shards to double the effect of the 500% regeneration rate increase and gain the shield, healing, and melee energy the Stasis Shards give.\nUse Withering Blades at an enemies to refund grenade energy from Impact Induction, and to slow them and thus produce additional Stasis Shards when killing them\nDodge near an enemy to fully refund one charge of Withering Blade\nThe next kill after dodge will create an Orb of Power from the Reaper mod\nCollect the orb for health, ability regeneration, and to improve the efficacy of Grenade Kickstart"

      }
    },
    "HowItWorks": "This PvP build takes advantage of the many intricacies that Strand Hunter can utilize around the Grapple ability. The exotic for the build is Cyrtarachne's Facade which gives Woven Mail for 10 seconds each time Grapple is used. This improves survivability by granting damage resistance to body shots. \n\nThe other benefits of Grappling are granted through the Fragment Thread of Ascent which gives the following bonuses after using Grapple: reloads equipped weapon, grants increased Handling, bonus Airborne Effectiveness, and increased Reload Speed. Strand Hunter gets two Grapple charges, so be sure to Grapple to an existing Grapple Tangle to refresh these buffs for free as it will not utilize Grapple's charge if shot at a Tangle.\n\nThe other very important Fragment of the build is Thread of Transmutation which creates a Tangle when the user has Woven Mail. Tangles can be shot to create an explosion that can be buffed by the artifact perks Untangler and Threaded Blast to Suspend targets hit by the blast. With the build most kills will create a Tangle due to how often Grapple will be available. Be sure to shoot the resulting Tangle when other enemies are nearby to chain together kills and take out clustered opponents.\n\nOn the surface, the super is arguably the weakest part of Strand Hunter's kit, but can be a strong portion if used properly. The Fragment Thread of Binding is used to buff the super by emitting a Suspending burst on super final blows for easier multi-kills. It is important to know that Grapple and Ensnaring Slam can continuously be used while in super. This makes it easier to close the gap on targets and Suspend other supers to win 1v1 super fights. Grapple and Ensnaring Slam can be used in tandem in or out of super, and it is recommended to try to land behind enemies to force them to turn around. Use those abilities to supplement the super and stick to the light attack which has a quicker cast time, one shots enemies, and has a generous hit box.\n\nThe final Fragment slot is a flex spot per the users choice. Good options are Thread of Rebirth for a potential Threadling being created on Strand Weapon kills or other Fragments that grant stat bonuses.\n\nThe mods of the build are for buffing Strand weapons by boosting Handling, Reload Speed, Accuracy, and reducing flinch. The other important mod to take note of is the use of two Reaper mods. This will create Orbs of Power when getting a kill after a dodge. When two orbs spawn the first will be at the target's location, the second will spawn in the very center of the map.\n\nStrand Hunter is now the fastest subclass in the game with their newly acquired mobility. Leveraging this mobility will allow the user to get the most out of the build. The first thing to know is cancelling the Grapple. To do so use the Grapple then cancel by pressing the Grenade button again or swapping weapons. This allows the user to have a weapon out when engaging rather than waiting on the ready speed. The second tech is to Grapple, shoot, then melee. This lets the user quickly change directions to juke an enemy or even get in a quick melee after a shotgun shot to finish a weakened enemy. The next tech is the swing around which allows the user to quickly traverse the map by singing around corners, to do so shoot Grapple at a corner to be rounded, move the cursor away from the corner, and then steer the cursor along the bend. The final tech is being able to stay in air indefinitely. With two charges of Grapple, shoot one Grapple to create a Grapple Tangle in the air, shoot the Grapple Tangle with the other Grapple charge, Jump (which is refreshed after a Grapple), and repeat. This can be used to hover over corners, get away from supers, etc.",
    "GameplayLoop": "Grapple to quickly Traverse the map, get weapon stat bonuses, reload weapon, and gain Woven Mail\nKill any opponent with or affected by Strand abilities to create a tangle.\nShoot the Tangle to chain together kills.\nIf Dodge was used prior to the kill collect the created Orbs of Power for reduced grenade cooldown and to begin health regeneration"

This also applies to the suspend explosion because we consumed our grenade and all the Suspend blast\u2019s functions as a Grenade now. Because of this, the Suspend Blast can deal double the damage, it can spawn orbs of power from the firepower mod, and proc other mods like Bolstering Detonation that gives rift energy when dealing damage with a Grenade!

Then using the Briarbinds to beef up that Void Soul and make it last longer on the battlefield! This Build is simple as you can see by the ability rotation section, but it is the strongest Voidlock seen so far thanks to these new gauntlets!

If the enemy does get too close, your shotgun can be used to clean them up.\nThe fragments both help with aerial play and survivability, which should be leaned into to get the most out of this build.

The build utilized arc weapons as an example, but feel free to utilize any element weapons in the game, but be sure to match your helmet's Siphon and Weapon Surge mods with the element of the weapons you choose. Precision kills on suspended enemies should not be too hard to achieve because they are... floating in the air and can't move. Kills on Suspended targets will then feed back into getting your Barricade back through the Thread of Mind Fragment.\n\nOnce Orbs of Power are collected it will boost your weapon damage. These stacks of Armor Charge will go away once Barricade is used again because of Utility Kickstart. This will give more Barricade energy at the cost of losing the arc damage buff.

Picking up an Orb of Power will give Woven Mail from Thread of Warding and a small heal from Recuperation for survivability. \n\nWeapons of this build are purely preference, just be sure to match the elements of the mods with the element of the weapons you choose to utilize.",

Thread of Ascent is being used to reload your rocket launcher and is accomplished by shooting your first Grapple to create a Grapple Tangle, and then when your rocket launcher is out of ammo shooting your second Grapple charge at the Grapple Tangle to reload the rocket launcher. Izanagi's Burden takes a while to charge reload and swap to and from which gives just enough time for the intrinsic cooldown of Thread of Ascent to finish, allowing the auto-reload to be performed on Hothead.\n\nThe last bit of this build is to be sure to have both Grapple charges available before DPS starts, otherwise you won't be able to take advantage of indefinitely being able to use the second Grapple charge on the Grapple Tangle created from the first Grapple charge.",

Between all of these sources of healing and recovery, enemies will have a difficult time taking you down.",

These will also provide the benefit of extending your chaos reach super length when doing damage for even more boss damage and ad clear.\n\nThere are a couple different ways you can make ionic traces. First off with your aspect electrostatic mind any ability kill or arc debuffed target will grant an ionic trace. This also has the benefit of making you amplified when picking up ionic traces as well. If you are running the arc soul aspect not only will just your abilities make ionic traces but any arc soul kill will as well. Taking the fragment spark of ions will make it so when you defeat a jolted target you will make an ionic trace and this well stack with electrostatic mind. The final way of making ionic traces is with the fragment spark of discharge so any arc weapon final blow has a chance to make one.\n\nFor arc weapons, running any weapon with the voltshot perk works great because when reloading after a kill you can apply jolt to an enemy which when killed will proc electrostatic mind and spark of ions with the chance of also pricing spark of discharge. You can also run Coldheart so when doing sustained damage the weapon itself can make ionic traces. Other than those Delicate Tomb will also be another great option for making ionic traces. Once again since all of these do arc damage they all have a chance to proc spark of discharge.\n\nSince getting jolt kills can make ionic traces running spark of shock so all of your grenade damage can jolt enemies is very strong. This just means now even your grenades can grant super energy and pairing that with the mod ashes to assets you can get energy from getting kills with them as well.\n\nFor survivability the fragment spark of resistance is very nice so when surrounded you get a damage reduction. Since you can spam abilities all the time I would highly recommend taking healing rift so you can healing pools that provide arc souls to your entire team everywhere. Running a recuperation mod is also very helpful so when picking up and orb of power you gain some health.\n\nOh and since you can spam rifts everywhere take a dynamo mod for even more super generation!",
    "GameplayLoop": "Get kills then reload your weapon to proc voltshot\nGet a kill with voltshot active to make an ionic trace\nGet any ability kill to also make an ionic trace\nSpam every ability repeatedly since ionic traces refill your ability energy further making more traces\nPickup all the ionic traces to fill your super chaos reach up extremely fast\nUse chaos reach on bosses or any high health targets (it\u2019s also pretty good for ad clear if needed)"

Getting kills with Vex Mythoclast will also grant overcharge stacks which can be used to turn it into a linear fusion rifle. If you have the catalyst the overcharge stack will also grant damage, accuracy, and stability.\n\nTo make the build easier to play taking the icarus dash aspect makes movement extremely fluid and when it\u2019s performed with Rain Of Fire equipped all of your weapons are reloaded. This is extremly strong for just general play but it gets crazy when pairing it with rockets for dps.\n\nFor survivability taking the healing grenade to apply cure and restoration is very strong. You then can take the aspect touch of flame to buff the cure to heal more and the restoration to a x2 restoration. Phoenix dive is also a great choice for a fast cooldown and the ability to cure as well. Cure and restoration can be applied to teammates as well and should be prioritized to proc the fragment ember of benevolence to give you further increase regeneration to your cooldowns.\n\nFragments like ember of empyrean will make it so when you get Vex Mythoclast kills it will re-proc the restoration timer to make you unkillable. Ember of tempering is nice to have because solar weapon kills will make firesprites that will grant you more healing grenade energy. On top of that it will grant a stacking recovery bonus for you and nearby allies alongside an increase to your airborne effectiveness. The final fragment is ember of solace to further increase the timers of the radiant and restoration so you can always have them proc'd at all times.\n\nThe final note is the fact that this setup can deal with every champion. With a chill clip fusion rifle you can stun overloads, when you are radiant you can stun barriers, and unstoppable fusion rifle is an artifact perk this season.",

When standing next to a Stasis Crystal which will be in every Duskfield Grenade, you will get 40% damage resistance from Whisper of Chains. Between these buffs, maxed resilience, and damage resist mods you can get up to 90% damage resistance with this build.\n\nHaving this survivability is great, but this build also allows you to spam abilities. Duskfield Grenades can be regained in a few seconds by destroying a Stasis Crystal which will grant 600% grenade regeneration rate with Whisper of Shards. Withering Blade can have its cooldown automatically refunded with activating Gambler's Dodge or reduced when picking up Stasis Shards. Stasis Shards are created when defeating slowed or frozen targets with Grim Harvest, but doing so will also give Dodge energy with Whisper of Refraction. Not only will Stasis Shards give melee energy, but they will build up armor charge with the Elemental Charge mod.",

Your fragment thread of warding will also grant woven mail on orb of power pickup. With woven mail and the healing from banner of war you are almost unkillable even in the thick of things.\n\nFor faster melees your aspect into the fray will also grant you increased melee regeneration when you have woven mail active.

Your fragment thread of fury will also help gain some melee energy when you deal damage with a tangle. To make more tangles the fragment thread of transmutation will let you generate them on weapon kills while you have woven mail active.\n\nFinally your super bladefury can do insane damage paired with everything in this build so always be sure to use it on bosses. The grenade is up to you with your choice of either being shackle for more endgame content or grapple to play further into the melee aspect of the build.

Malfeasance is best for boss damage, Crimson is a hybrid of boss damage and add clearing, and Sunshot is best for add clearing and has the benefit of resetting Restoration and Radiant timers by swapping to Ember of Empyrean and Ember of Mercy for Firesprite creation.\n\nFurther damage stacking is build up with Ember of Torches which gives a 25% bonus after a melee hit. Weapon Surge mods will also increase damage, so equip as many as possible, maxing out at a 22% bonus for 3 mods. Hand Cannon uptime is increased with Marksman's Dodge which will reload your weapon, Marksman's Dodge's cooldown is improved with Ember of Singeing which gives a 300% class ability cooldown buff when scorching a target. \n\nOrbs of Power are created with weapon kills from a Siphon mod as well as on Knife Trick kills from Heavy Handed. When all of the damage buffs are stacked together you'll have the following total damage buffs:\n\nAll enemies - 967%\nRed Bar enemies - 1192%\nOrange Bar - 1768%",

Your grenade can blind enemies because you will be running the flashbang grenade which inherently has a blind effect to it. Finally your special weapon can blind enemies with the fragment spark of beacons so arc special weapon final blows will make a blinding explosion.\n\nTo spam abilities repeatedly, the aspect electrostatic mind creates ionic traces when defeating blinded and jolted targets. Picking up the ionic traces will grant ability energy to all of your abilities. You can further spam your class ability because of the aspect arc soul. Not only will this give you an arc buddy that can put out a lot of damage but it will also reduce the cooldown of your rift when standing near teammates. Pairing that with the Vesper Of Radius and the fragment spark of focus you can have unlimited blinding rifts whenever you want. Since you can spam your class ability armor mods like dynamo, bomber, and utility kickstart are extremely strong.\n\nOther things to round out the build are things like the fragment spark of shock to make your flashbang grenade not only blind enemies but also jolt them as well. With one grenade you can stun unstoppable champions (blind) and overload champions (jolt). The final fragment is spark of resistance to gain damage reduction when near enemies. You will always be near enemies with the build to its aggressive playstyle so this is a must to take.",

    "HowItWorks": "The main crux of this build is based around the trinity of Radiant Dance Machines, Withering Blade, and Gambler's Dodge. The exotic Radiant Dance Machines allow you to continuously dodge when securing a kill while The Dance is active. These extra dodges activate Gambler's Dodge, which then enables you to throw infinite Withering Blades.  In order for The Dance and Gambler's Dodge to activate, you need to be within a close proximity of an enemy.\n\nStasis pairs nicely with these boots as Withering Blade will apply 60 slow stacks to an enemy, and only 100 stacks are needed to freeze most enemies in the game including mini-bosses and champions. The Aspects used are Grim Harvest and Touch of Winter. Grim Harvest will spawn Stasis Shards when killing a stasis debuffed target, which is any enemy hit by a grenade or Withering Blade. These Stasis Shards are made good use of with Whisper of Rime which make them heal you and provide an Overshield as well as the Elemental Charge mod which gives them an escalating chance to give an Armor Charge. \n\nTouch of Winter and Whisper of Durance will buff the Duskfield Grenade by making it larger in area, last 2 seconds longer, and creates a Stasis Crystal in the center. When standing near this Stasis Crystal or a frozen enemy, Whisper of Chains will give 40% damage resistance. Shattering this Stasis Crystal, Whisper of Shards will give a 500% bonus base grenade regeneration rate buff for 6 seconds.\n\nFrozen enemies will not only give damage resistance, but will also give a 60 stat increase to your mobility, resilience, and recovery, a 30 stat increase to weapon stability, a 15 stat increase to weapon aim assist, and a 20 stat increase to airborne effectiveness with Whisper of Hedrons. These buffs are nearly always up and let you prioritize other stats.",

Quickfall gives 9 seconds of invisibility and Snare Bomb as well as dodge grants 7 seconds. If Vanishing Step is used while still invisible from a Quickfall cast it will actually give 9 seconds of invisibility. The final means of becoming invisible is through a finisher due to the Echo of Obscurity Fragment.\n\nInvisibility can be chained indefinitely with Quickfall and Gambler's Dodge as using dodge near an enemy will completely refund a Quickfall charge and grenade hits will refund both melee and class ability energy.\n\nOrbs of Power are important for this build as they grant Devour through Echo of Starvation, give armor charge for Utility Kickstart and Grenade Kickstart, and refund grenade energy with Innervation. Orbs are created by weapon kills with a Siphon mod, kills after dodging with the Reaper mod, and by defeating weakened enemies with the Echo of Harvest Fragment.",

Vesper of Radius on it\u2019s own will grant you greatly increase cooldown rate when surrounded by enemies. The fragment whisper of refraction will grant you class ability energy on frozen target kills, which your rift can do. Finally to take advantage of the armor charge the mod utility kickstart will grant you some rift energy when you fully expend your class ability energy.\n\nTo round things out the fragment whisper of fissures will grant you some extra shatter damage to make your rift kill more. The fragments whisper of conduction will make your stasis shards track to you for easier gameplay. Finally the fragment whisper of bonds will give you some extra super energy on frozen target kills.

When a Jolted target is defeated they will create an Ionic Trace by Spark of Ions.\n\nCooldowns are supplemented by the mods. Both Utility Kickstart and Grenade Kickstart are utilized to quicken cooldowns on ability usage. Grenade and Dodge will feed into one another with Bomber and Bolstering Detonation.

Radar manipulation is performed through the use of invisibility and the Gemini Jester exotic boots. Dodging and utilizing of snare bomb makes you invisible, and the latter can be used to make teammates invisible as well. When dodging within 22 meters of an enemy they will lose their radar, have diminished audio, and take a tick of one damage. This tick is very important in assessing enemy locations as it is a floating number that can be seen through walls.\n\nWith the advantage of invisibility and/or enemies not having radar, you and your team can pinch enemies and get the first strike in an engagement for a clear advantage in a fight. Do so with the use of a Scatter Grenade or Snare Bomb to weaken enemies, or with a high burst damage weapon such as a hand cannon.\n\nIf opening an engagement with a dodge, your next kill will create an Orb of Power from the Reaper mod. Picking up the orb will heal you and begin health regeneration, giving sustain to continue fighting or disengage with invisibility.\n\nThe weapons of the build are purely preference, but be sure to match the Targeting, Loader, and Unflinching mods with the primary of your choice.",

Between the reflective shield and Overshield, it is very hard for an enemy to kill you as you are running them down.\n\nThe slide can be paired with a Shotgun or Fusion Rifle. When sliding charge the Fusion or shoot the Shotgun and then after the slide and special weapon shot you can still activate Shield Bash. This makes it such that if the special weapon does not kill the target, Shield Bash will, and you'll gain an Overshield, heal from Echo of Leeching, and immediately pick up the Orb of Power the enemy spawns from Reaper. This Orb of Power will heal you, activate Devour, and give a damage buff from a weapon surge mod.\n\nThe last portion of the build is the grenade.

    "HowItWorks": "The power of fantasy of No Backup Plans calls for a run and gun playstyle with a shotgun. You can do this, but in reality using the buff to one-shot Champions and damage down bosses is what this exotic does best.\n\nThe process starts with acquiring an overshield. To do so cast a Barricade, land a hit with Shield Throw, pick up a Void Breach to activate Protective Breach, or via No Backup Plans by getting multiple shotgun kills or a shotgun kill on a powerful enemy with melee energy available. Once you have a shield you get a 35% damage bonus for shotguns, and all that needs to happen is landing a shotgun kill with the overshield still active to refund it. This works in tandem with Echo of Starvation which grants Devour after an Orb of Power pickup. Devour will heal you and replenish grenade energy. Grenades will weaken enemies with Echo of Undermining and grant Volatile Rounds for a void weapon on a kill when using Echo of Instability.\n\nThese gauntlets pair for outputting excessive damage with Legend of Acrius that hits like a truck on its own, then adding in Surge mods and the No Backup Plans damage buff makes this thing essentially insta-kill most enemies in the game.\n\nThe shotgun Last Man Standing can also work in this build, specifically with the Discord perk. You can activate Discord by getting a kill with a different weapon, then switch to LMS. While Discord is active, final blows with the shotgun will refund ammo, so you won't be wasting your ammo on lower tier enemies when you kill them, which can help play more towards the fantasy of this exotic.",

These bonuses stack with a Well of Radiance and all together make Malfeasance deal 16.5x its base damage. The Lucky Pants buff only lasts for 5.5 seconds, and then has a 10 second cooldown. This is the primary window in which you'll then use Apex Predator.\n\nApex Predator is utilized as it has Reconstruction to passively reload when using other weapons which synergizes well with Bait and Switch that is activated by utilizing all weapons for a 35% damage bonus. The cycle is started off by shooting Apex Predator because this initial shot counts towards activating Bait and Switch, giving maximum uptime for the 35% damage bonus.\n\nTo up DPS during the cycle Marksman's Dodge and Whisper of Impetus are used to circumvent reloading. Whisper of Impetus will reload stowed weapons when using Withering Blade, so be sure to have your energy weapon out before throwing Withering Blade to reload both Apex Predator and Malfeasance.",
